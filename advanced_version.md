## <span style="color:black"> __First Content Notes__ </span>
<span style="color:grey">
This is where you take notes on your content. In the following content blocks, you can find useful tips for markdown. When taking your own notes, just delete the text that is already there and write your own.

## <span style="color:black"> __Markdown Formatting__ </span>

<span style="color:grey">

* you make a heading with \#, one for a level one heading, which is the largest - you can go down to level 6
* starting a new line: use a double space
* use single asterisks or underscores to make words italic (\*words* makes *words*) 
* use double asterisks or underscores to make words bold (\*\*this** makes **this**)
* use both at the same time with three asterisks or hyphens (\_\_\_ x ___ makes ___x___)
* you make a divider with three hyphens (---)
* you can make unordered lists with an asterisk (*) and ordered list with any number, a period and a space: \1.  
(__super useful__: it doesn't matter which number you choose, it will be displayed as 1,2, etc. )
</span>

## <span style="color:black"> __Links, Quotes, Pictures and GIFs__ </span>

* you can use links in your notes by using this formatting:  
[link text](link URL “title”) becomes [neue fische website](https://www.neuefische.de/ "neue fische website")
* you can also use pictures in your notes by using this format:   
![image text](image URL) becomes ![neue fische logo](https://www.neuefische.de/neuefische-gmbh-logo.svg)
* block quotes: you can highlight a quote from someone by using an angle bracket (>), for example: 
    > I think there is a world market for maybe five computers. - Thomas J. Watson Sr.
* use GIFs with the same formatting as links and pictures, the URL you use must end with .gif and if it expires, your gif will not be seen anymore  
example: ![Fish Gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/KAI3j7HLC93Lq/giphy.gif)

## <span style="color:black"> __Taking Good Notes__ </span>

<span style="color:grey">

* stick to one style, e.g. links are in italic, keywords are in bold, dividers inbetween topics, etc.  
* don't vary your text style too much, keep it simple
* use bold and italic words rarely so they stand out more

</span>

## <span style="color:black"> __Code inside notes__ </span> 
You can insert blocks of code into your notes with Markdown by wrapping the code in backticks (\`)
\`/from x import y\` becomes  
`/from x import y`
